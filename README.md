# SendToEmbed
SendToEmbed is a Windows application that can send a customizable Discord embed with the usage of a webhook.

## Features
SendToEmbed allows you to:
- Set a thumbnail to the embed you're editing
- Add fields to your embed (including inline ones)
- Include files on top of your embed
- Customize the embed's details on the author
- Change the colour of the embed you wish to send (or well, the colour of the bar to the left of it)
- Edit the embed's description and footer text
It can also let you save your embed as a template that can be reused in the program to avoid refilling all the details.<br>
Note that it's mandatory to include the webhook URL.

## Downloads
SendToEmbed is only released for **Windows**. Despite that, you can try to run it on macOS or Linux with its source code.<br>
To download SendToEmbed, please check out the Releases section. The latest version is `V1.0.0`.<br>
If you wish to run by source, ensure your Python version is 3.11 or higher.

## Credits
This app was developed in Python 3.11 with the `tkinter` module and TOML.<br>
Thanks to user **lovvskillz**'s [discord_webhook](https://github.com/lovvskillz/python-discord-webhook) module that I used.<br>
I used Piskel to draw the icon (and Pixilart to resize it).
